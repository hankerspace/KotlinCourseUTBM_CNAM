- Advanced collections 

### 2. Imperative programming - Exercises

The second part of the course is about imperative programming exercises.
You'll have to solve some exercises to practice what you've learned in the first part.

7 exercises are available :

- Math functions : implement some math functions
- Romain numerals : convert numbers to roman numerals
- Pokemon names : find the longest pokemon name
- Multifactorial : compute multifactorial of a number
- Taxi numbers : find taxi numbers (numbers that are the sum of two cubes)
- Smith numbers : find smith numbers (numbers that are the sum of their digits)
- Nims game : create the nims game

### 3. Object-oriented programming

The third part of the course is about object-oriented programming.
All the main concepts of object-oriented programming are covered and illustrated with Kotlin code.

It covers the following topics :

- Classes and objects
- Inheritance
- Abstraction
- Interfaces
- Enumerations
- Data classes
- Generics
- Exceptions

### 4. Object-oriented programming - Exercises

The fourth part of the course is about object-oriented programming exercises.
You'll have to solve some exercises to practice what you've learned in the third part.

4 exercises are available :

- Precipitations : compute the average precipitation of a list of cities
- Game of life : implement the game of life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
- Defibrillators : find the closest defibrillator to a given location 
- Tree explorer : create and explore a tree structure

### 5. Functional programming

The fifth part of the course is about functional programming.

**You need to have a good understanding of imperative programming to understand this part.**

It covers the following topics :

- Higher-order functions
- Lambdas
- Function composition
- Closures
- Scopes
- Extension functions

### 6. Functional programming - Exercises

The sixth part of the course is about functional programming exercises.

3 exercises are available :

- String operators : create some string operators
- Doors : the corridor of doors problem

### 7. Transversal exercises

These exercises are transversal and cover all the topics of the course.

**You need to have a good understanding of imperative programming, object-oriented programming and functional programming to understand this part.**

- Shapes : create a graphical application that displays shapes
- Towers of Hanoi : create the towers of Hanoi game
- Highways : create a highway with tolls and compute the price of a trip
- Regex : create a regex engine
- Snake : create the snake game
- Tic Tac Toe : create the tic tac toe game
- Lord of the rings : create a game based on the Lord of the Rings universe

### 8. Design patterns

Some of the most common design patterns are excluded because they are already covered by the Kotlin language (singleton, iterator, etc.).

10 design patterns are covered :

- Chain of responsibility
- Factory
- Abstract factory
- Decorator
- State
- Bridge
- Template method
- Memento
- MVC
- Observer

### 9. Design patterns - Exercises

Some exercises are available to practice what you've learned in the eighth part.

3 exercises are available :
